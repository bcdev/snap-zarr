            <h4>This reader/writer - format is a beta version.</h4>
            <p>
                This format will replace the BEAM-DIMAP format in the near future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using this format for production purposes is not yet recommended, as parts of the format may still
                change.<br>
                However, it would be very helpful if you use this format for testing purposes to give us feedback.<br>
                In order to optimize the reader/writer in the best possible way for the requirements<br>
                of the users, feedback is very welcome.
                For Feedback please use

<h3>Export SNAP-ZARR Product</h3>

<p>This command allows to export the data of the current product to SNAP-ZARR format.</p>

<p>SNAP-ZARR uses the
    <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
        <param name="content" value="https://jzarr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">
        <param name="text" value="<html><u>JZarr framework</u></html>">
    </object>
    , which is a Java implementation of the
    <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
        <param name="content" value="https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">
        <param name="text" value="<html><u>Python Zarr library.</u></html>">
    </object>
</p>

<h3>Constraints of created SNAP-ZARR product files</h3>

<p> The exported product consists of a root zarr group and zarr-sub-groups and/or zarr-arrays.
    The root node contains meta information related to the product. The child nodes can then be
    further groups or zarr arrays. Subgroups are used to group related data. Raster data are stored
    in zarr arrays.<br/>
    An exported product is fully compatible and thus directly processable with the
    <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
        <param name="content" value="https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">
        <param name="text" value="<html><u>Python Zarr library.</u></html>">
    </object>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Name and type of the product.</li>
    <li>Name, description and unit of each band.</li>
    <li>The properties of no-data and scaling for each band.</li>
    <li>The index coding of a band.</li>
    <li>Virtual and filtered bands.</li>
    <li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    For features and limitations of the SNAP-ZARR export and constraints of interaction with other GIS tools please see
    the following list:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>All bands of a SNAP-ZARR file must have the same data type. Therefor a common data type is identified which
        fits for all bands. Double precision data type is not supported.
    </li>
    <li>The data of a band is always written raw and unscaled.
    </li>
    <li>Virtual and filtered bands can only be reimported by the Sentinel Toolbox.</li>
    <li>All projections available in SNAP are also supported by the SNAP-ZARR writer.
        As a fallback, if a map projection or other geocoding is not directly supported a tie-point grid is written to
        the SNAP-ZARR file.<br/>
        The exported SNAP-ZARR files were tested for compatibility with ENVI and ArcGis. While the files are fully
        compatible with ENVI, ArcGIS has problems to understand stereographic projections.
    </li>
    <li>An index coded band can only be correctly decoded by other GIS tools, if it is written as an image with one
        band.
    </li>
</ul>
